My Solution for Data Science Bowl 2018
======================================

The challenge is to build a model for nuclei segmentation. The solution should generalize well to even work for unseen types of slides.

My reason to join the competition is to learn about instance segmentation. So I decided to build the model from scratch rather than using ready-to-use implementations.


## Dataset
